\title{Coefficient of variation (CV)}
\usage{
cv(x, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector}

\item{na.rm}{logical. Should missing values be removed?}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar -- the sample coefficient of variation.
}
\description{
Compute the coefficient of variation (CV). The CV, also known as relative standard deviation (RSD), is a standardized measure of dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution.
It is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean and is often expressed as a percentage.
In contrast to the standard deviation, it enables comparison between datasets as the CV is independent of the unit in which the measurement has been taken.
If \code{na.rm} is \code{TRUE} then missing values are removed before computation proceeds.

\section{Details}{

The coefficient of variation (CV) should be computed only for data measured on a ratio scale (i.e. data with an absolute zero). The CV may not have any meaning for data on an interval scale.

According to \cite{Dormann 2017} CV-values below 0.05 (5\%) indicate very high precision of the data, values above 0.2 (20\%) low precision.
However, this is considered as a rule of thumb. In studies of highly variable systems (e.g. some ecological studies) CV values above 1 may occur.

The CV of a zero-length vector (after removal of \code{NA}s if \code{na.rm = TRUE}) is not defined and gives an error.
If there is only a single value, \code{sd} is \code{NA} and \code{cv} returns \code{NA}.
