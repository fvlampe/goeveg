\usage{
syntable(
  vegdata,
  groups = NULL,
  abund = "percentage",
  type = "percfreq",
  digits = NULL,
  long = FALSE,
  group_col = NULL,
  phi_method = "default",
  phi_transform = "none",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{vegdata}{A data-frame-like object. Either:
\itemize{
  \item default: a species-sample matrix with species in columns and samples in rows.
        Species names must be column names, sample (row) names are optional.
  \item with \code{long = TRUE}: a long-format table with at least three columns: sample ID, taxon name, and abundance/cover
        (these must be the first three columns).
}
Missing values (NA) are converted to 0.
If non-numeric abundance values are present, the matrix will be transformed to presence/absence with all non-zero values defined as 1.}

\item{groups}{Group identities for samples. For wide data (\emph{default}): a vector/factor of length
\code{nrow(vegdata)} (one group per sample/row). For long data: either a
per-\emph{row} vector (length \code{nrow(vegdata)}), a per-\emph{sample} vector
(named by sample IDs, or in the order of first appearance of samples), or
\code{NULL} when \code{group_col} is used. Within each sample, exactly one group
must be defined.}

\item{abund}{Type of abundances: percentage cover (\code{"percentage"}, default)
or presence/absence (\code{"pa"} with values 0/1). Use \code{\link{cov2per}}
to transform cover-abundance scales to percentage cover if needed.}

\item{type}{Output type. One of \code{c("percfreq","totalfreq","mean","median","diffspec","phi")}.
See \strong{Details}.}

\item{digits}{Integer indicating the number of decimal places to be displayed in result tables (default 0; for phi 3)}

\item{long}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, \code{vegdata} is treated as long-format data; otherwise as species-sample matrix (\emph{default})}

\item{group_col}{(Long data only) Optional name of a column
in \code{vegdata} that contains the group labels. When supplied, \code{groups}
may be \code{NULL}.}

\item{phi_method}{Fidelity measure when \code{type = "phi"}. One of:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"default"}: binary phi coefficient (classical)
  \item \code{"cover"}: cover-weighted phi (correlation of cover with group membership)
  \item \code{"ochiai"}: Ochiai coefficient
  \item \code{"uvalue"}: hypergeometric \eqn{u}-value
}}

\item{phi_transform}{Transformation for cover-based fidelity (\code{phi_method = "cover"}):
\code{"none"}, \code{"sqrt"}, or \code{"log"} (applies \code{log(x + 1)}).}

\item{phi_standard}{Group-size standardisation for fidelity:
\code{"none"} (original sizes), \code{"rarefy"} (random rarefaction to the smallest
group, repeated \code{phi_reps} times), or \code{"adjust"} (analytical adjustment;
defined for \code{"default"} and \code{"uvalue"}).}

\item{phi_reps}{Number of repetitions for random rarefaction (default 100).}
}
\value{
The function returns an (invisible) list of result components.
  \item{\code{$syntable }}{unordered synoptic table for given species and groups}
  \item{\code{$samplesize }}{total number of samples per group}

Additionally for differential species character calculation:
  \item{\code{$onlydiff }}{Synoptic table only with differential species}
  \item{\code{$others }}{List of non-differential species}
  \item{\code{$differentials }}{Lists differential species for each group}
}
\description{
Synoptic tables summarize previously defined plant community groups, e.g., from

They help to determine characteristic patterning of species occurrences in plant communities
by calculating group-wise percentage or absolute frequencies, mean/median cover values, fidelity
(phi) or differential species character.

\code{syntable} calculates synoptic tables, using vegetation sample data and a vector of groups identity.
The vegetation data can either be provided as species-sample matrix (\emph{default}) or as long-format vegetation 
data (one row per species occurrence) (\code{long = TRUE}). 

The unordered output table can be sorted automatically with \code{\link[goeveg]{synsort}} function.
}
\section{Details}{

For synoptic table calculation, six types are available.
  \itemize{
  \item \code{type = "percfreq" }: percentage frequency of occurrence per group \emph{(default)}
  \item \code{type = "totalfreq" }: absolute frequency (number of plots with presence) per group
  \item \code{type = "mean" }  mean cover per group (\code{abund = "percentage"} only)
  \item \code{type = "median" }  median cover per group (\code{abund = "percentage"} only)
  \item \code{type = "phi" } Calculates species fidelity. The default corresponds to the
   classical phi coefficient (Sokal & Rohlf 1995, Bruelheide 2000) with values between -1 and 1.
   Alternatively, a cover-weighted phi based on correlation, the Ochiai coefficient or the
   hypergeometric \eqn{u}-value can be selected via \code{phi_method} (see Chytry et al., 2002). Group size effects can
   be handled via \code{phi_standard}.
  \item \code{type = "diffspec" } Calculates differential character of species according to
   Tsiripidis et al. 2009, with resulting character p = positive, n = negative, pn = positive-
   negative or no differential character (-). Consider that differential character is always
   restricted to some and not necessarily all of the other units, thus considering percentage
   frequency is essential for correct interpretation of the diagnostic species character.
   This calculation needs at least 3 groups.
   }

For sorting the output synoptic table, use \code{\link{synsort}} function, providing several
options.
