\item{distance}{Dissimilarity index used in vegdist.}

\item{k}{Number of dimensions (default \code{k = 6}).}

\item{trymax}{Maximum number of random configuration for iterative search search of stable solution.}

\item{autotransform}{Whether to use transformation (see \code{\link[vegan]{metaMDS}}) or not. Default is \code{autotransform = TRUE}.}

\value{
A numeric vector of length \emph{k} containing stress values for \emph{k} dimensions.

\description{
This function provides a simple plot of stress values for a given number of tested dimensions (default \code{k = 6}) in NMDS.
This stress plot (or scree plot) shows the decrease in ordination stress with an increase in the number of ordination dimensions.
It is based on function \code{\link[vegan]{metaMDS}} (\code{vegan} package) and uses the \code{monoMDS} engine.
}
\section{Details}{

Goodness of Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) is measured by stress value.
The lower the stress value, the better fit of original distances/dissimilarities and projected distances in ordination diagram is reached.
Stress value depends on dimensionality; it is decreasing with increasing dimensionality. On the other hand, stress-reduction does not mean to maximise interpretation capability.
Low-dimensional projections are often better to interpret and are so preferable for interpretation issues.
The stress plot (or sometimes also called scree plot) is a diagnostic plots to explore both, dimensionality and interpretative value.
It provides dimension-dependent stress reduction and curve estimate gives indices for meaningful stress reduction with increasing dimensionality.
Furthermore, another diagnostic plot for detecting best dimension for projection of NMDS, the Shepard diagram (\code{\link[vegan:goodness.metaMDS]{stressplot}}) is recommended for detecting best dimensionality in NMDS.

\cite{Clarke 1993} suggests the following guidelines for acceptable stress values:
<0.05 = excellent, <0.10 = good, <0.20 = usable, >0.20 = not acceptable.
The plot shows the border of the 0.20 stress value limit. Solutions with higher stress values should be interpreted with caution and those with stress above 0.30 are highly suspect.
