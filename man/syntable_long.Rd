\title{Synoptic tables and calculation of cluster-wise frequencies and fidelity for
long-format vegetation databases}
\usage{
syntable_long(
  vegdata,
  cluster,
  abund = "percentage",
  type = "percfreq",
  digits = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vegdata}{A data-frameâ€“like object in long format, with at least the columns. The first three columns must contain
sample names, taxon names and abundances, respectively.}

\item{cluster}{Integer or character vector/factor with classification
cluster identity for each sample. Ensure matching order of cluster identity and samples in vegdata for correct allocation of cluster numbers to samples.}

\item{abund}{Type of abundances. Define whether the third column contains
percentage cover (`abund = "percentage"`, default) or presence/absence
data (`abund = "pa"`, with values 0/1).}

\item{type}{Type of synoptic table output
`type = c("percfreq", "totalfreq", "mean", "median", "phi")`. See Details.}

\item{digits}{Integer indicating the number of decimal places to be
displayed in result tables (default 0).}
}
\value{
An (invisible) list with components:
  \item{\code{$syntable }}{unordered synoptic table for given species and clusters}
  \item{\code{$samplesize }}{total number of samples per cluster}
}
\description{
Synoptic tables are a tool for the visualization and interpretation of previously
defined plant species groups (clusters), e.g. from cluster analysis, classification methods or
pre-defined categories, e.g. spatial distribution units.
They help to determine characteristic patterning of species occurrences in plant communities
by calculating cluster-wise percentage or absolute frequencies, mean/median cover values or fidelity
(phi) values. 

`syntable_long` calculates synoptic tables from long-format vegetation data (one row per species occurrence)
where the first column contains the sample identifier. A parallel vector provides the cluster identity for each sample.
It is therefore particularly suited for comprehensive vegetation databases, where usual species-sample matrices are very large.
The unordered output table can be sorted automatically with \code{\link[goeveg]{synsort}} function.
 
For data in wide species-by-sample matrix form, use the companion function \code{\link[goeveg]{syntable}}.
}
\section{Details}{

For synoptic table calculation, five types are available.
  \itemize{
  \item \code{type = "percfreq" } Creates a percentage frequency table \emph{(default)}
  \item \code{type = "totalfreq" } Creates an absolute frequency table
  \item \code{type = "mean" }  Calculates mean of species values given in \code{matrix} per cluster
  \item \code{type = "median" }  Calculates median of species values given in \code{matrix} per
   cluster
  \item \code{type = "phi" } Calculates fidelity measure phi (algorithm basing on Sokal & Rohlf
   1995, Bruelheide 2000). Values are ranging between -1 and 1 with high values near 1 indicating
   high fidelity.
   }

For sorting the output synoptic table, use \code{\link{synsort}} function, providing several
options.
