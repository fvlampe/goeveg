# goeveg 0.7.9
* `syntable()`: Fixes in fidelity calculation when using the u-value; added Fishers's exact test to exclude non-significant fidelity
* `syntable()`: Added options for standardization of sample group size
* `hcr_resampling()`: Added checks for groups limits
* Harmonized terminology between `synsort()` and `syntable()`: Both refer to groups instead of clusters now.

# goeveg 0.7.8.
* New function `hcr_resampling()` to perform heterogeneity-constrained random (HCR) resampling (Lengyel, Chytrý & Tichý, 2011)
* `syntable()`: Added new options of fidelity calculation (u-value and Ochiai index); improved speed using more vectorised computations
* `syntable()`: Added option to calculate synoptic tables from long-format vegetation data; implemented with `data.table` for faster performance on large databases.
* `synsort()`: Added `method = "totalfreq"` (order species by overall frequency) and `method = "manual"` (order by a user-supplied vector).
* `synsort()`: The species–sample matrix is no longer returned by default (for faster performance on large datasets); set `samples = TRUE` to include it.
* `synsort()`: Added `cluster_order` to select and order cluster columns; columns not listed are omitted.

# goeveg 0.7.6
* `per2cov()`: Fixed a mistake leading to wrong cover value assignments in specific cases

# goeveg 0.7.5
* `syntable()`: Added argument to define number of decimal places in results
* `clean_matrix()`: Empty cell values are transformed to 0; fixed to work correctly with non-numeric values in data tables

# goeveg 0.7.4
* `cov2per` and `per2cov`: Added option to transform with individual scales per sample
* `trans_matrix()`: Added option `rmchar` to remove the first character of the original column names


# goeveg 0.7.3
* New function `clean_matrix()` to remove species without occurrences (frequency = 0) and samples without species from a species matrix in one simple step
* New function `trans_matrix()` to transpose a species matrix, while preserving correct species and sample names. 
* Simplified function `merge_taxa()` with increased performance
    * Added option `backtransform` to decide whether cover-abundance values should be kept as percentage cover or back-transformed into original cover-abundance values
    * Option `drop_zero` renamed to `clean_matrix` and set on FALSE by default
* `cov2per`: Fixed an error when providing a data frame with only one column as community data
* `syntable`: Fixed an unnecessary warning message occurring at cover value transformation

# goeveg 0.7.2
* Cover-abundance scales:
    * Added scale "niwap" from Lower Saxony species survey programmes (Schacherer 2001)
    * Added `x`-value to presence/absence scale
* `merge_taxa()`:
    * returns names of merged taxa only once (not for each relevé)
    * added option `drop_zero` to decide whether species without occurrences or empty samples should be removed or kept
    * fixed an error when providing individual scales for each sample
* `syntable()` and `merge_taxa()` automatically repair imported tables with empty character values ("")

# goeveg 0.7.1
* `syntable()` can now handle factorial variables for defining clusters, e.g. to summarize relevés according to pre-defined categories and is more flexible regarding the format of the community matrix 
* Terminology was harmonized between different functions

# goeveg 0.7.0
* New functions added:
    * `merge_taxa()` for merging taxa/species with identical names
    * `cov2per()` and `per2cov()` for conversion between cover-abundance codes and percentage cover
* `dimcheckMDS()` is renamed into `screeplot_NMDS()` with enhanced description and progress bar

# goeveg 0.6.5
* Fixed wrong species labeling in `racurve()` when `freq = TRUE`

# goeveg 0.6.4
* Added functions `deg2rad()` and `rad2deg()` for conversion between radians and degrees
* Updated data table `schedenenv`

# goeveg 0.6.3
* Fixed wrong p-value calculation for GLMs in `specresponse()`
* Fixed problem with NAs in `specresponse()` when showing point values

# goeveg 0.6.2
* Added na.action argument to `specresponse()`

# goeveg 0.6.1
* Explained deviances and p-values are now printed in `specresponse()`. Full model results are returned in an (invisible) object. 
* Added functionality to select the least abundant (rarest) species in `ordiselect()`

# goeveg 0.6.0
* (Re-)added functions for calculation and sorting of synoptic tables: `syntable()` and `synsort()`
* Comprehensive update for `ordiselect()`. Now returns exact proportion of selected species. Correction in selection to axis fit limits. Variable fit now only works with factor centroids. 
* Updated help pages
